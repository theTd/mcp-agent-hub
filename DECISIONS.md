# Decisions

Design decisions confirmed by the owner. Change a line here before changing the behaviour it records.

## Web console (2026-11-05, console UI redesign)

| id | decision | default kept |
|---|---|---|
| file-structure | Console front end is split into `static/css/hub-console.css` + ES modules under `static/js/`, served by the `/static` mount in `server.py` (no bundler). | yes |
| brand-name | Top bar shows "Sub-Agent Hub" with the Chinese subtitle "MCP 聚合网关 · 非无头终端总控台". | yes |
| profile-id-edit | A saved profile's ID is read-only; renaming is "复制为新 Profile" (duplicate) then delete the old one. | yes |
| terminate-confirm | Closing a session asks for confirmation only while its process is alive (changed 2026-11-06: was "while its status is starting / running / waiting_parent"); a session whose process has ended is removed in one click. | yes |

## Profiles and launching (2026-11-06, profile redesign; owner: "change it however you see fit")

| id | decision |
|---|---|
| profile-identity | A Profile is a launch recipe (engine, command, args, task mode, default model, default thinking level, when_to_use). Model and thinking level are chosen at launch; variants per model/thinking are not Profiles. Old variant ids were dropped without aliases. |
| agent-guidance | Guidance for parent agents lives in three places: Profile `when_to_use`, per-model notes (`engine_policies.<engine>.model_notes`), and the thinking rule of thumb in `global_routing_instructions`. |
| thinking-injection | The hub injects model and thinking per engine and strips them from saved args: omp `--model=/--thinking=`, kimi `-m` + env `KIMI_MODEL_THINKING_EFFORT` (child only), agy model-name suffix, codex `-m` + `-c model_reasoning_effort`, dsh via the DSH spec. Saved args may not contain these flags. |
| disabled-default | A disabled default model is replaced by the first enabled model, and the launcher, preview and toast say so; an engine with no enabled model refuses to launch. |
| codex-synthesis | Codex profiles are no longer synthesised from ~/.codex config or recent configurations. |
| quick-keys | Terminal quick keys go over the PTY WebSocket, never the parent-message mailbox. |
| waiting-parent | The console shows a sub-agent's question to the main agent in full but does not answer it. |
| launch-wording | UI says 启动 (not 拉起). |
| launcher-after-launch | The launcher collapses after a successful launch without changing its saved expanded/collapsed preference. |
